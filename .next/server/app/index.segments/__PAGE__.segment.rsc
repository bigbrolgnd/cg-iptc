b:T94a9,<p>The postwar democratic surge that swept across Southeast Asia created, for a fleeting moment, the possibility of an anticolonial politics that was simultaneously rooted in local conditions and connected to global struggles for liberation. No publication captured this vision more eloquently than <em>Fengxia</em> (“Below the Wind”), the sophisticated weekly that emerged from Singapore’s Chinese intellectual circles in 1946. Under the editorial stewardship of Hu Yuzhi, the journal articulated an internationalist framework that would soon collide with the particularist demands of nascent nationalism—a collision most dramatically illustrated in its fierce debate with the Malayan Communist Party over the proper geography of revolution.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hu Yuzhi and the Malayan Spring</strong></p><p>Hu Yuzhi (1896–1986) arrived at Singapore’s postwar crossroads bearing credentials that spanned continents and ideologies. Born to modest Zhejiang origins and shaped under Lu Xun’s tutelage, Hu had emerged by the 1920s as a driving force in China’s new literature movement, championing both the democratic promise of vernacular Chinese and the cosmopolitan vision of Esperanto. His ascent through Shanghai’s publishing world—from early work at the Commercial Press to editorial stewardship of prestigious journals like <em>Eastern Miscellany</em> and <em>World Knowledge</em>—established him as a literary critic of formidable standing. A Sorbonne education in international law, coupled with a homeward transit through the Soviet Union, equipped him with that rarest of combinations: firsthand European experience wedded to profound domestic engagement.</p><p>The Japanese occupation of Malaya had forced Hu into a harrowing three-and-a-half-year exile in Sumatra, where he survived under the alias “Zhang Shangfu” as a rice wine brewer while mastering Indonesian sufficiently to compile China’s first Indonesian grammar. His September 1945 return delivered him to a Singapore transformed: British authority lay fractured, communist networks stood emboldened, and the world order hung in precarious equilibrium. Hu moved swiftly to resurrect progressive networks from wartime’s wreckage, launching <em>Nanqiao Daily</em> with Tan Kah Kee’s financial support and establishing the New Nanyang Publishing House from an unassuming Cross Street shophouse.</p><p>British colonial intelligence compressed him into operational shorthand—“believed to have contact with the C.P. in Siam”; “has agents throughout Java and Sumatra”—while Victor Purcell, the former Chinese Protectorate official, furnished more vivid portraiture of this “little homunculus of a man with bright eyes like a marmoset,” whose physical presence belied his intellectual stature. Purcell recognized in Hu “an ego in bas relief ”—energetic, ambitious, and determined—whose intellectual project aimed at “reconciling the differences between the various Chinese parties and sections.” That method—his facility across political grammars, both polite liberalism and militant communism—revealed itself under interrogation when Hu expounded on press freedom “for some two and a half hours” before inundating officials with bilingual missives warning that “the withholding of liberties will, ultimately, hurt the British the most.”</p><p></p><p><strong>Fengxia’s Internationalist Mission</strong></p><p><em>Fengxia</em>—bearing Hu’s editorship, pen name, and publishing imprimatur—presented a sophisticated fusion of political commentary, literary work, and social analysis that Purcell deemed “far above the level of any Chinese journalism which we have had before in Malaya.” The journal’s nomenclature carried symbolic weight: <em>Fengxia</em> derived from the Malay <em>negeri di bawah angin</em>—land below the wind—which had designated these monsoon-swept lands for centuries. But new winds now swept maritime Asia. From “Java, Annam, Burma, and Calcutta” rose battle cries for freedom; soon “the South Pacific and Indian Ocean” would be “swept by unprecedented fierce waves.”</p><p>The journal positioned itself between translation and localization, committed to “understand the ‘land below the wind,’ to listen to its oppressed and enslaved voices, and to reflect their wishes and demands.” No publication in postwar Malaya more forcefully articulated decolonizing Asia’s cry for unity: “one billion oppressed people” demanding continental solidarity against imperialism’s dying grip. Across “turbulent Asia,” new nations struggled against old empires and fresh hegemonies, yearning for “peaceful, democratic, and free” futures. Imperialism’s universal character unified seemingly disparate struggles: “China’s problem,Vietnam’s problem, Indonesia’s problem, India’s problem, Burma’s problem” appeared distinct yet proved “completely identical in essence.”</p><p>Singapore afforded Hu a panoramic vantage on decolonization’s sweep. The city concentrated Asia’s contradictions: “dozens of different ethnic groups” embodying struggles between democracy and authoritarianism, between ideals and reality, between oppressors and oppressed. Through this crossroads flowed Asia’s revolutionary energies—Indonesian republicans, Chinese communists, Indian nationalists transited here, their ideologies cross-pollinating. <em>Fengxia’s</em> coverage embodied this pan-Asian vision: Burma’s march toward freedom drew praise for Aung San’s magnetism; Vietnam’s anti-colonial war earned fierce support for its resilience; Indonesia commanded extensive reportage, with sympathies reserved for the socialist Sutan Sjahrir and the legendary communist Tan Malaka. Yet India dominated coverage, its continental scale and scattered diaspora echoing China’s own predicament—both nations stalked by famine, fractured by partition, yearning for genuine independence.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"

The first admitted easy resolution. “China and Asia share inseparable destinies,” the journal proclaimed, demanding reciprocal support between China’s internal revolution and Asia’s independence movements: political solidarity in struggle, economic cooperation in development. Hu’s sweeping narrative of modern China’s “four revolutions”—the Xinhai Revolution, Northern Expedition, Long March, and ongoing Civil War—charted how China’s successive upheavals had inspired anti-colonial movements across the continent. The “two basic tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism,” he argued, belonged not exclusively to China but to “all Asian national revolutions,” creating an “inseparable relationship” between Chinese revolution and Asian nationalism.</p><p>The overseas Chinese question proved thornier. In principle, the journal labored to recast the overseas Chinese as bearers of revolution, invoking Nanyang’s “revolutionary legacy” to encourage alliance with local nationalist movements, urging them to “join hands with oppressed nations on the path of genuine freedom.” At the height of postwar possibility, Hu’s “On the Dual Mission of the Overseas Chinese” articulated complementary rather than competing loyalties to Chinese motherland and Southeast Asian homelands. Hu dismissed three partial approaches—economic self-interest, exclusive homeland loyalty, or complete local integration—as insufficient. Promoting Chinese democracy and supporting regional independence, he argued, were not opposing duties but parallel fronts in the continental struggle against empire. Diasporic participation in local struggles, he concluded, strengthened distant China; China’s freedom, in turn, helped “oppressed nations advance toward freedom.” Distance, Hu suggested, was not the diaspora’s burden but its gift to the revolution.</p><p>This dream of serving two revolutions foundered on the birth of nations. <em>Fengxia’s</em> advocacy for overseas Chinese participation in nationalist struggles ran against movements increasingly suspicious of foreign influence, forcing stark choices between local citizenship and Chinese allegiance. Hu’s response distinguished four gradients of belonging: temporary sojourners, permanent Nanyang residents, colonial-born Straits Chinese with British or Dutch citizenship, and local-born creoles of “mixed blood.” With three of his four categories rooted in Southeast Asian soil, the balance tipped inexorably toward local citizenship. Hu’s own irresolution surfaced in his Democratic League activism, which marshaled overseas capital and political energy for mainland struggle: “We are all patriotic Chinese with the right to speak as masters of China.” This ambivalence reflected broader sentiment: when surveyed, 98% of overseas Chinese still considered their motherland to be “in Tangshan, in the northern continent, in China.”</p><p>In important ways, however, philosophy superseded politics in Hu’s analysis. While his colleagues parsed federation mechanics and constitutional technicalities, Hu retreated into theoretical contemplation, pursuing the deeper question of “national form” (<em>minzu xingshi</em>). Southeast Asia’s historical peculiarity—territories whose plural societies, welded by colonial artifice, exhibited starkly uneven political development—posed novel theoretical questions. Could “national form” exist without the singular nation it ostensibly required? India and China inherited national concepts awaiting modern content; Southeast Asia possessed only plurality awaiting conceptual form. The theoretical challenge—giving form to plurality—demanded dialectical method: “Content and form are contradictory but also unified,” Hu wrote, recognizing that nationalism faltered precisely where it forced plural content into singular form. In Southeast Asia, plurality ascontent would generate its own unprecedented form—adequate to its own complexity, not despite but through its contradictions. In his vision, nations constituted “people’s collectives” organized around shared political, economic, and cultural institutions. Democratic citizenship would spring from institutional commitment rather than the accidents of birth or bonds of blood—participation, not pedigree, as the measure of membership. This theoretical foundation enabled his analytical distinction of nation (<em>minzu</em>) from ethnicity (<em>zhongzu</em>): colonial Malaya’s “three major nations”—Chinese, Malay, and Indian communities with distinct political identities—would transform with independence from national entities into ethnic constituents of unified Malayan nationhood. This model diverged sharply from Soviet federalism’s contingent unity, where constituent republics retained secession rights, and envisioned instead ethnic diversity within national unity—plurality without the possibility of partition.</p><p>Hu brought these theoretical insights to bear on contemporary citizenship debates through a crucial distinction: <em>jiaxiang</em> (hometown), designating where overseas Chinese actually lived, worked, and raised families, versus <em>zuguo</em> (homeland), signifying the ancestral China that claimed them through bloodlines. This parsing exposed how Chinese nationality law—still conferring citizenship through patrilineal descent—had become an anachronism, at odds with democratic principles that anchored belonging in territorial presence and civic participation. Hu’s vision ultimately transcended liberalism’s tepid multiculturalism and socialism’s mechanical federalism. For the overseas Chinese, he imagined something unprecedented: full Malayan citizenship within a plural national form, Chinese ethnic identity intact.</p><div

Self-styled as the “people’s newspaper,” their flagship publication <em>Voice of the People</em> (<em>Minsheng Bao</em>) pledged to reflect popular struggles while its content addressed material urgencies—food distribution, grocery prices, factory conditions—linking unions across the peninsula through strikes and demonstrations.</p><p>The MCP initially shared <em>Fengxia’s</em> vocabulary of international solidarity. They converged on strategic foundations: global revolutionary analysis identifying declining capitalism confronting ascending socialism, and regional coordination recognizing Malaya’s fate as inseparable from Southeast Asian decolonization. Yet by 1947, the party’s rejection of extraterritorial allegiances marked a decisive break with <em>Fengxia’s </em>cosmopolitan vision. The MCP reordered priorities to flow “primarily toward Malaya, secondarily toward ancestral countries,” meaning India or China. While granting the magnetic pull of homeland struggles, party officials declared any privileging of these “partial interests” over Malaya’s self-determination incorrect and counterrevolutionary. Its analysis singled out Malaya’s putative “national bourgeoisie”—these Chinese rubber barons and tin magnates, factory owners and merchant compradors—as revolutionaries of convenience, whose politics were hostage to imperialisms old and new, bound as they were by British credit lines and American market indices. Their revolutionary pretensions, however ardently proclaimed, remained as calculated as they were conditional, their solidarity with China calibrated for commercial advantage, and their class interests precluding genuine support for Malayan revolution.</p><p>This logic of “Malayanization” led the MCP toward the work of nurturing Malay nationalism, supporting nascent organizations, and invoking kinship with Indonesia’s anti-colonial struggle. The party wagered heavily on the Malay Nationalist Party, directing cadres to mobilize mass participation and promote unity across all nationalities. By mid-1946, party resolutions insisted that Malayan Chinese surrender their “overseas Chinese character” and dedicate themselves exclusively to local movements. Internal dispatches censured members’ “narrow patriotic perspectives” in their sustained focus on China, while editorial guidelines prioritized Malayan issues, with Southeast Asian concerns receiving secondary attention and China issues merely residual coverage. The factional schism with the China Democratic League—Hu’s political vehicle—tore open for all to witness. The CDL stood accused as “indifferent toward British imperialism,” while the MCP reserved sharpest invective for unnamed critics, almost certainly CCP representatives, who consigned Malaya to the waiting room of revolution: those who deemed it “still backward,” who cast Malayans as uncommitted sojourners, who prescribed “long-term” revolution and glacial progress, and who considered its “revolutionary prospects dim” without Chinese victory—in short, those “making extremely harmful, erroneous arguments” by deferring Malayan agency to Chinese precedent. In practice, this meant the Chinese and Indian communities who had lived as proof of cosmopolitan solidarity must now disown the internationalist commitments that had defined their political identity.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Literary Battlefield</strong></p><p>The tensions between the MCP’s rooted localism and Fengxia’s expansive internationalism, long forestalled out of political courtesy, erupted into open dispute by late 1947, surfacing in the seemingly gossamer concerns of literary purpose. This intellectual tempest forced Chinese thinkers to confront the elemental question of sovereign belonging, with <em>mahua</em> (Malayan Chinese) and <em>huaqiao</em> (overseas Chinese) emerging as incompatible visions. The debate’s center of gravity proved to be <em>cishi cidi</em>—“here and now”—as both aesthetic principle and political commitment.</p><p>The debate began with an incendiary polemic “On Malayan Chinese Literature,” published in December 1947 by MCP intellectual Zhou Rong. The essay shattered the tenuous détente with its verdict of double betrayal on part of Hu Yuzhi and his associates: both of artistic integrity and political commitment. Literature without locality, he pronounced, was mere “overseas Chinese literature”—derivative, subordinate, forever gazing elsewhere. His assault proceeded through interlocking propositions: authentic literature must achieve distinctiveness through inhabiting the concrete reality of “here and now”; work lacking such grounding never charted “the leading direction of Malayan Chinese literary creation.” </p><p>Zhou’s critique challenged the temporal calculus that ranked China’s “urgent” revolution above Malaya’s “long-term” reform. Distance sufficed for political commentary—“holding newspapers and looking skyward”—but literary creation demanded immersion among “typical characters and typical environments.” His coup de grâce targeted mainland writers stranded in Malayan indifference: while “waiting for the great liberation of the Chinese people,” they generated otiose work, addressing neither the China they had left nor the Malaya they refused to see. “If crossing oceans changes nothing in one’s writing,” Zhou asked, “what was the point of such arduous passage?”</p><p>The riposte from Singapore’s literary left proved swift and sophisticated. Li Xuan and Hu Yuzhi—the latter writing under pseudonym—brought genuine philosophical rigor to their defense of universalism. Literature’s authentic mission lay not in local specificity but in exposing “all evil phenomena of this time”—a definition that privileged political content over geographical accident. Colonial Malaya and semi-feudal China were variations on imperialism’s theme: “China has its corrupt officials, Nanyang its amoral merchants; China has its feudal reactionaries, Nanyang its idle literati.”</p><p>Hu’s contribution, appearing under the condescending title “Friend, You’ve Entered a Dead End!,” masked philosophical rigor beneath avuncular bemusement. His crucial insight separated form from content with lapidary precision: “Literary forms may reflect ethnic particularity, while content must remain international.” Chinese literary forms could voice struggles recognizable in any colonial context without aesthetic dilution. His examples disproved geographical determinism: Lu Xun, who “never visited Malaya,” had captured Malayan Chinese reality more profoundly than any local literature; Gorky authored Russian masterpieces from Italian exile; Gogol’s <em>The Government Inspector</em> still reflected “the reality of here and now” when staged in Shanghai or Singapore.</p><p>Employing a horn-shaped diagram, Hu traced Zhou’s path from reasonable premise—“literature requires its own identity”—through progressive narrowing to its farcical terminus: demands for “British authorities to deport foreign-born Chinese writers.” The force of this <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> revealed that cultural nationalism, taken to its endpoint, coincided with colonial exclusion. By severing Malaya from global struggle—“drawing a circle isolating Malaya from the world”—Zhou had committed not intellectual error alone but political betrayal of internationalist solidarity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"

Twilight of Internationalism</strong></p><p>For all their sophistication, however, the internationalists misread history’s direction. They saw anti-colonial struggles as variations on a theme, assumed literature’s borderless currency, and dismissed local specificity as parochialism—convictions soon drowned by decolonization’s particularist tide. They could not know the Emergency would make their ideals not just obsolete but seditious, internationalism itself the first casualty of political repression.</p><p><em>Fengxia</em> represented the last moment when it seemed possible to imagine an anticolonial politics that refused the choice between narrow nationalism and colonial cosmopolitanism. Hu Yuzhi’s vision—plural content generating its own adequate form, a nation capacious enough to contain its contradictions without resolving them into false unity—offered a path not taken. The journal’s pages preserve not just the historical record of a forgotten debate but the ghost of an alternative future, one where solidarity across borders mighthave survived the transition to independence, where the Chinese diaspora might have found belonging without erasure, where the universal and particular might have achieved their promised dialectical resolution.</p><p>That this vision failed makes it no less significant. In our own moment of resurgent nationalisms and fractured solidarities, <em>Fengxia</em>’s internationalist dream—however brief its flowering—reminds us that the particularist logic of nation-states was not inevitable. Other futures were once possible, and might be again.</p><p>…</p><p><strong>Kelvin Ng is a PhD candidate and Fox International Fellow at Yale University </strong></p>6:["$","$La",null,{"article":{"title":"Below the Wind: Fengxia and the Dream of Anticolonial Internationalism in Postwar Malaya","link":"https://discourseonanticolonialism.substack.com/p/below-the-wind","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:04:25 GMT","content":"$b","summary":"Kelvin Ng","image":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i4bZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72c78d3b-66fc-4b5d-9440-6c70cfb7b526_842x706.png","guid":"https://discourseonanticolonialism.substack.com/p/below-the-wind"}}]
